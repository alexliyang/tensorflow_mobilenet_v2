# Mobilenet_v2 in tensorflow
The very rough version of mobilenetv2 in tensorflow implementation

## Insertion to train from scratch
The network structure is evolved from tensorflow.models.research.slim.  
Please adopt the nets_factory.py and preprocessing_factory.py into your folder.  
Lastly, add mobilenet_v2.py into your models/research/slim/nets.

## Declaration
If any luck, you have some idea about this code. Please feel free to open an issue or PR to me :)  
I'm still immature to tensorflow, there might be some error inside the bone structure.  
Having any question, please contact me via lcycoding@gmail.com
